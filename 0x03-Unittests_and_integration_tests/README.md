# utils Testing Project

This project contains unit tests for the `utils` module, specifically the `access_nested_map` function.

## Overview

- The `access_nested_map` function accesses values in a nested mapping (dictionary) using a sequence of keys.
- The test suite verifies that the function returns expected values for various input maps and key paths.
- Tests are implemented using Python's `unittest` framework along with the `parameterized` library for parameterized testing.

## Running Tests

Make sure you have the `parameterized` package installed:

```bash
pip install parameterized
